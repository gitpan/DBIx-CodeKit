CodeKit Version 1.06 released 2003.05.07.

CodeKit is an interface to a universal database code table.
CodeKit takes all of the programming work out of maintaining
multiple database code definition sets.

The code administration page lets you define new virtual
code tables and enter all codes and their descriptions.
Perl and PHP classes retrieve the code descriptions and
automatically generate HTML code selection elements.

   Get your universal code table schema and sample data loaded.

2. See doc/ck_setup_perl.html and doc/ck_setup_php.html
