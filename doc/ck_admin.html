<center><h2>
<a href="http://www.webbysoft.com/codekit">CodeKit</a>
Administration Page</h2></center>

The CodeKit Administration Page lets you enter codes
and their descriptions into the universal code table.

<h4>Code Set Page</h4>

The code set page shows a list of the code sets and their
respective record counts:

<pre>
code_set             5
country             87
currency            12
day                  7
month               12
                   123
</pre>

<p>
Click on any of the code sets along the left column
to see and edit a list of the codes in that set.

<h4>Selecting Another Code Set</h4>

At any point you can click on the "Code Set Page"
link to return to the overview and then click
on any of the code sets there.

<p>
The other navigation aid is always displayed at the top
of every page:

<pre>
      Select a code set
     [Code Set?]  [View]
</pre>

This select dropdown lets you specify the code set
that you are interested in.  Then click [View]
to see the selected set.


<h4>Adding a New Code Set</h4>

Click on "code_set" along the left margin of the
Code Set Page or select "Code set" from
the navigation dropdown to see the current list
of code sets.  Click the "Add new code set record"
link at the bottom of the page.

<p>
Enter the new code set code and description.  For example
"city" and "city".  Click the "Multiline Set" box if appropriate.
See the <a href="ck_overview.html"> CodeKit Overview</a> page
for an explanation of this option.  Click [Add] and
you have a new code set programmed and ready to use!


<h4>Code Display Order</h4>

When adding or updating a code you can specify its
display order by entering a number in the "Code Order"
field.  Negative order numbers can be used to make
a code sort early.

<p>
When a code is first added if the order field is not
specified and the code field value is numeric, the
order field is set to the value of the code field.
This provides numeric sorting of numeric codes by default.


<h4>Obsolete Codes</h4>

When the time comes to retire a code from active use
there are two approaches:  deletion or deprecation.
The problem with deletion is that the code value may
still exist somewhere in the database.  When it comes
time to display the code description for a deleted
code value only the actual code value is available
which can be rather cryptic.

<p>
The solution is to mark obsolete codes as deprecated
without removing them from the code set.  This leaves
the obsolete code descriptions in the code set for
display purposes, but does not allow new data entry
selection of deprecated code choices.

<p>
To deprecate a code click the "Deprecated" checkbox
and then click [Update].


<h4>User Permissions</h4>

The Code Administation Page contains hooks to allow
or disallow any combination of code addition,
update, or deletion.  Combined with user authentication
these hooks can be set up to give different users different
privileges for different code sets.
